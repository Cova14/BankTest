# BankTest

So... This is a test to see if I use only javascript to do what I did on the Neo4j Desktop app
Spoiler: I DID IT
The bad part is that there's no style, so please don't judge too much

# How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. "npm install" in your terminal
3. "node app.js" to run the app (Did you notice you need node to use this?)

# IMPORTANT NOTES 
The JSON files are only available on the repo directory, so you have to clone the repo necessarily.

I hope I can make a page where you can see some data and download the JSON files(**send help**)

**_ONLY GOD KNOWS HOW THIS CODE WORKS_**
