# BankTest

So... This is a test to see if I use only javascript to do what I did on the Neo4j Desktop app
Spoiler: I DID IT
The bad part is that there's no style, so please don't judge too much

# How to use
-Clone the repo
-npm install in your terminal
-node app.js to run the app

# IMPORTANT NOTES 
The JSON files are only available on the repo directory, so you have to clone the repo necessarily
I hope I can make a page where you can see some data and download the JSON files(send help)
*ONLY GOD KNOWS HOW THIS CODE WORKS*
