# BankTest

So... This is a test to see if I use only javascript to do what I did on the Neo4j Desktop app.


Spoiler: I DID IT.

The bad part is that there's no style, so please don't judge too much.

# How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. "npm install" in your terminal.
3. "node app.js" to run the app (Did you notice you need node to use this?).
4. Go to localhost:3000

# Update
Now there's a Json file with the properties of all the Movement nodes available.

The code runs when the page load the first time and the Json file it's updated, just like the other ones.

# IMPORTANT NOTES 
The JSON files are only available on the repo directory, so you have to clone the repo necessarily.

You can add more banks, but there's no code to add relationships or anything else to those banks... Yet

The "Importar" button only takes the info from the .txt file in the files directory. The code was created specifically for that file and (hopefully) won't create duplicate values(The nodes are already created)

I hope I can make a page where you can see some data, download the JSON files, import your own files, etc.(**send help**)

**_ONLY GOD KNOWS HOW THIS CODE WORKS_** (And you too, probably. Not too complex)
